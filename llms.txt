# 0nMCP — Universal AI API Orchestrator

> 0nMCP is the most comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server available. It provides 252 tools across 17 services through a single natural language interface. Free, open source, MIT licensed.

## What is 0nMCP?

0nMCP is a universal AI API orchestrator built on the Model Context Protocol. It federates multiple services — Stripe, Slack, GitHub, Shopify, Twilio, SendGrid, Discord, OpenAI, Airtable, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, Supabase, Calendly, Google Calendar, Resend, and a full CRM with 245 tools — into a single natural language interface.

Instead of building Zapier workflows, writing custom API integrations, or learning visual automation builders, you describe what you want in plain English. 0nMCP figures out which APIs to call, in what order, and chains the data between them.

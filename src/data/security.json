        "a": "Unlike password managers that store individual credentials, 0nVault encrypts entire orchestration contexts -- 7 semantic layers including workflows, MCP configs, site profiles, and AI brain states. It supports multi-party escrow, tamper-proof seals, and secure transfer with replay prevention."

      },
      {
        "q": "What encryption does 0nVault use?",
        "a": "AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption, Ed25519 for digital signatures, X25519 ECDH for key agreement in multi-party escrow, Argon2id for credential key derivation, and SHA3-256 for content-addressed integrity seals."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I verify a container without decrypting it?",
        "a": "Yes. The Seal of Truth uses SHA3-256 content hashing to produce a verification fingerprint. Anyone with the seal can verify the container has not been tampered with, without needing the decryption key."
